# SQL-HR-Analysis-Challenge
Given internal datasets of past employees, designed a database to understand "what drives high performing employees to quit?". Determined main drivers of churn and provided actionable recommendations.

# SQL Projects 

Here is what my projects will demonstrate

* Queries and clauses such as inserting comments, INNER JOIN, LOWER, UPPER, Using aliases "AS" and much more

* More complex queries such as SUBSTR, SELECT INFO, CREATE VIEW

* Editing a table, creating a database (most relevant for SQL challenges)
* Constraints (ex. PRIMARY, AND FOREIGN KEYS, CASE WHEN, CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
* More complex queries (ex. PIVOT, PARTITION BY, OVER)
